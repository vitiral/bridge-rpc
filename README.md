# Bridge: A Universal Bridged RPC Protocol

> **This library is in the design phase.**

Bridge is a protocol designed to allow a system of different devices, to
communicate with each other and issue commands through (optionally) guaranteed
unique remote procedural calls. It allows inter-network communication through the
concept of "bridges". Both nodes and bridges can be highly resource constrained
devices (such as microcontrollers). Intended supported networks include tcp/ip,
UART, CAN and ZigBee.

The Bridge Protocol has the following requirements:
- lightweight: both nodes and bridges can be run on microcontrollers with as
  little as 4k RAM and no memory allocation.
- simple: The entire protocol is governed by a small set of easy to
  implement rules and there are only two kinds of devices: nodes and bridges.
  Bridges are just nodes which also store a register of existing nodes and pass
  data along to its destination.
- network agnostic: can be run on any network that is masterless and has the
  ability to broadcast (tcp/ip, UART, CAN, etc).
- bridged: enables seamless communication between different networks via
  what are known as "bridge nodes". Through bridges, a node on ethernet can
  communicate with a node on CAN (or any other protocol) through an arbitrary
  number of bridges.
- flexibly robust: supports any range on the spectrum of robustness vs
  guaranteed performance. When configured, data can always be re-requested
  and the user is guaranteed to never accidentally get duplicate data or call
  the same RPC twice.
    - functions can be configured to never drop their return values (until the
      initiator clears them) in order guarantee crticial data
    - functions can drop their return values immediately for idempotent
      operations and guaranteed performance.
    - functions can have user-defined events of when they drop values
      (i.e. timeout, buffer fullness, etc)
    - functions can store an index and only run when the index matches the
      `cx_id` given in the RPC, guaranteing that functions cannot be run
      twice accidentally.

The library will be split up into several crates:
- bridge-constants: provides generated constants for multiple languages
- bridge-logic-rs: contains core rust data types and logic handlers to implement
  the protocol.
- bridge-std-rs: contains higher logic implemented using the std library (including
  heap memory allocation and threading).
- bridge-uc-rs: contains higher logic implemented for microcontrollers (no heap
  memory allocation or threading)

The reference and primary implementation for all device types shall be in rust.


# Bridge Operation
A bridge is simply a pass through node: messages who's `init_uid`/`exec_uid` do
not equal the bridge's own `node_uid` are simply passed through to the correct
node/bridge in the chain.

> The direction the message goes is determined by the type. Request types are
> always going to the `exec_uid` and Response types are always going to the
> `init_uid`.

The bridge knows where data goes because it holds a table of `node_uid`s mapped
to the protocol-specific addresses of the next bridge. It learns of the
`node_uid`s/addresses through the Discovery phase.

The discovery phase goes as follows:
- the bridge sends out `FN_BROADCAST_BRIDGE`
- other nodes and bridges respond with `FN_REGISTER_SELF`
- whenever another bridge calls `FN_REGISTER_SELF`, `FN_STREAM_REGISTERED_NODES`
  is also sent to that bridge. This guarantees that the two bridges stay in
  sync.

# Function Description
Functions are the way in which the user's software communicates with other
nodes.

## Drop-able Functions
If the `dropable` bit is set, both the function call and the result of the
function are considered drop-able -- meaning that if the message is lost
in the network the data will be lost. This is extremely useful for cases where
it is better to just re-request the function than worry about lost data.
Note that any function can be made drop-able, but not all functions can be
asked to cache.

Good examples of drop-able fns are:
- `FN_PING` and `FN_HEARTBEAT`: where you just want the function to return a
  value. A dropped message simply indicates network issues, which is the point
  of these functions.
- info queries (`FN_GET_INFO`, `FN_GET_HW_INFO`, etc): for always getting the
  most up-to-date information.
- reactive data stream: if you have a system that is taking in streams of data
  (i.e. tempearature, light levels, distance monitoring, etc) and reacting
  to it then it shouldn't matter if a single message is dropped -- even if that
  message were retrieved there is nothing the system can do with past data. Get
  more recent data and move on.

## Stream Functions
If the `stream` bit is set (and `count` has a value), the RPC is a
"stream" type and will output `count` values. The values will also have
`stream=1` and have their `count` set to what index of the stream they are.

The `count` in the RPC controls the number of values to be received:
- If `count=0` then the number of values will be determined by the function.
- If `count=MAX_U32` then the stream will be infinite. Some functions, like
  `heartbeat` are flexible and can output any number of `count`. Almost any
  mixture of configurations is possible.
- `count>MAX_U32/2` returns `ERR_INVALID_COUNT` since the highest value of
  `count`

The period/frequency of data transmission is implementation specific for each
function. Functions like `heartbeat` might return data every second, or they
might only return data when it becomes available (i.e. for event monitoring).

## Indexed Functions
An indexed function is a function that keeps track of an internal `cx_id`.
`cx_id` starts at 1 and is incremented each time it is called. It will ONLY
execute RPC's with `cx_id` equal to it's internal one (invalid ones get
`ERR_INVALID_INDEX`).

The reason for this is simple: imagine you attempt to initiate an RPC to move
your robot forward 10cm. The call is received but you get no acknoledgement,
so you make the call again. Now, what happens if the executor actually gets
*both* RPCs? It would drive forward 20cm, potentially off a cliff -- not good!

By indexing the function, we can guarantee that:
- The RPC will only be executed one time, no matter how many times
  the command is received.
- If two nodes are executing RPCs on the same device, they won't step on
  eachother's toes.

Let's look at another example. You have a thermomiter which tries to set
the temperature of the thermostat to 29C, however it's message gets delayed
for 10 minutes. Two minutes later it sets it to 25C and that works. However,
8 minutes after being set to 25C it receives the message to be set to 29C --
what should it do? (obviously stay at 25C since that is the most recent
command).

> Note: If an indexed function needs to be accessed asynchronously by multiple
> devices, the `FN_STREAM_FN_EXEC_LOG` RPC can be enabled on it to stream all
> function calls to an external database. This would allow for a device to
> determine who executed what at which `cx_id`.

# Builtin Functions
Functions are defined in the form
```
DS FN_NAME {IV_NAME: ARG_TYPE, ...} -> {RV_NAME: RV_TYPE, ...} ![ERRORS]
```
where :
- `D` is the drop-able setting
    - `D` for "`dropable` only"
    - `G` for "`dropable` can be anything" (i.e. can be guaranteed)
- `S` is the stream setting
    - `V` for "`stream` must be 0"
    - `s` for "`stream` can be anything with any count specified"
    - `S` for "must be stream with any `count` specified."
    - `C` for "must be stream with exact `count` specified"
    - `U` for "must be stream with `count=0` (count unknown)"
    - `I` for "must be stream with `count=INFINITE` or `count=0` specified"
- `FN_NAME` is the name of the function
- `IV` is "input value"
- `RV` is "return value"
- `ERRORS` what function specific errors can be returned (empty if none)

Note: a return type of `ack` means that the function ONLY returns `ACK` (no
value).

## Network Functions
- `FN_PING DV {} -> ack ![]` the node is expected to only return an empty value
- `FN_STREAM_CLOCK DS {period_ms: int} {clock_us: u64} ![]` return the current
  microsecond value on the device's clock every `period_ms`. This can be used
  as a node's heartbeat. This ALWAYS uses `cx_id=1` to avoid duplicate streams.

## Bridge Node Functions
These functions are how communication happens from node -> bridge and
bridge -> node. These are used in node registration and discovery.

> Many of these can return bridge related errors documented in "Bridge Node Errors".
> These errors are represented by `BERR` below.

### Broadcast Functions
There are only two functions which have to be implemented in a network specific
manner. These are used for nodes and bridges to make sure other nodes know they
exist.

- `FN_BROADCAST_NODE DV {cluster_uid: u32} {} ![]`: broadcast that this node
  exists on a certain cluster. Bridges on that cluster will respond with
  `FN_REGISTER_BRIDGE`
- `FN_BROADCAST_BRIDGE DV {cluster_uid: u32} {} ![]`: broadcast that this bridge
  exists on a certain cluster. Nodes and bridges on that cluster will respond
  with `FN_REGISTER_NODE`

### Called by anything to anything:
- `FN_GET_BRIDGES DV {} {bridge_uids: [u16; 8], len: u8} ![]`: return up
  to the first eight bridges currently registered on the node (in ordered
  priority). Most nodes will not have more than 8 bridges.
- `FN_STREAM_BRIDGES GS {} {bridge_uid: u16} ![]`: return a stream
  of up to `count` bridges on the node. If `count` is 0 or `INFINITE` then
  stream all known bridges.

```
FN_STREAM_REGISTERED_NODES GI {}
-> {node_uid: u16, addr_type: u16, addr: [u8; 32]}
![BERR]`
```
Command for a bridge to stream all it's registered `node_uid`s whenever they
become available, including ones it already has and ones it will get in the
future. This is the primary command that allows bridges to stay up to date
on what other bridges have access to.

This ALWAYS uses `cx_id=1` to make sure that there are not multiple running
streams (but if the bridge went offline the stream may need to be restarted).

### Called by anything to a bridge:
- `FN_REGISTER_SELF DV {is_bridge: bool} -> {} ![BERR]`: register self with the
  bridge. Used during all bridge's discovery stage. `is_bridge` specifies
  whether the node is also a bridge.
- `FN_NODE_EXISTS DV {node_uid: u16} -> {exists: bool} ![BERR]`: return true if the
  bridge has the `node_uid` stored (and therefore knows how to reach it).

### Called by a bridge to a node
- `FN_REGISTER_BRIDGE GV {} -> {}`: register this bridge with the node. Used
  by a bridge if the node sends `FN_BROADCAST_NODE`.

### Node Recovery Functions
- `FN_UNREGISTER_BRIDGE DV {bridge_uid: u16} -> {}`: tell a node to unregister a
  bridge. Used if a bridge has stopped/failed.

### Bridge Node Recovery Functions (called by either node or bridge):
- `FN_FORCE_DISCOVERY DV {} -> {} ![BERR]`: force the bridge to re-enter the discovery
  phase (will momentarily bring it down).
- `FN_START_BRIDGE DV {} -> {} ![BERR]`: tell a bridge node that has been
  stopped to be a bridge again. NOP if node is already a bridge.
- `FN_STOP_BRIDGE DV {} -> {} ![BERR]`: force a bridge to stop acting as a
  bridge. Can be used if the bridge is misbehaving or there are too many
  bridges. The bridge will un-register with nodes before shutting down.

## Functions about Functions
```
FN_GET_FN_CX_IDS DU {}
    -> {fns: [{init_uid: u16, cx_id: u32}; 16], len: u8}
```
Get a stream (in batches of up to 16) of all `(init_uid, cx_id)` pairs running a
device's `fn_id`. This tells you how many of a specific function are running
concurrently.

```
FN_STREAM_CALLS GI {fn_id: u16, invalid: bool, with_input: bool}
    -> {cx_id: u32, init_uid: u16, input_len: u16, input: [u8; N]}
```
Get a stream of all (future) calls made to this node's `fn_id` as soon as they
are received.
- If `invalid=false` then only send calls that result in `ACK`.
- if `with_input=true` then also send the data received in the input.

> the length `N` of `input` is `input_len`

```
FN_STREAM_ALL_CALLS GI {
    only_user: bool,
    only_valid: bool,
    only_indexed: bool,
    only_undropable: bool,
    with_input: bool,
}
-> {cx_id: u32, fn_id: u16, init_uid: u16, input_len: u16, input: [u8; N]}
```
Get a stream of ALL (future) calls made to this node as soon as they are
received.
- if `only_user=true` then only send user functions (not builtin)
- if `only_valid=true` then only send calls that result in `ACK`.
- if `only_indexed=true` then only send calls to indexed functions
- if `only_undropable=true` then only send calls which have `dropable=false`
- if `with_input=true` then also send the data received in the input.

This function only accepts metadata of `cx_id=1` to prevent multiple streams to
the same initiator.

> the length `N` of `input` is `input_len`

## Node Control Functions
```
FN_GET_NODE_INFO DV {} -> {
    bridge: bool,           # true if node is a bridge
    num_networks: u16,
    max_buffer_size: u32,   # max buffer size in bytes
    cluster_uid: u32,       # the cluster this node is a part of
} ![]
```
Return info related to this library about the node.

```
FN_GET_HW_INFO DV {} -> {
    sleep: bool,        # true if device can sleep
    concurrency: bool,  # true if concurrency is supported
    ip_bus: bool,       # true if device uses IP
    can_bus: bool,      # true if device uses CAN bus
    uart_bus: bool,     # true if device uses UART
    zigbee_bus: bool,   # true if device uses ZigBee
    other_bus: bool,    # true if device has other bus

    cpu_name: [u8; 12],
    num_cores: u32,
    frequency_mhz: u32,
    ram_mb: u32,
    num_devices: u32,
  } ![]
```
Return information about the hardware of the device

```
FN_GET_RPC_INFO DV {} -> {
    rpcs_running: u32,  # how many rpcs are being run on this node
    rpcs_cached: u32,   # number of completed cached rpcs
    bytes_cached: u64,  # number of completed cached bytes
    rpcs_run: u64,      # total count of number of rpcs successfully started
} ![]
```
Return information about running processes

# The Message
The message is the data returned from all transactions. It must be able
to define the following characteristics:
- metadata about the message:
    - whether this is an error, RPC, a single-value, a stream-value, etc
        - if an error, what the error code is and what the data is.
        - if stream, what it's `count` is.
    - whether this message needs to be validated.
        - if so, what it's length and checksum are.
- context id (`cx_id`): the id that the caller has associated with this
  RPC context (call, ack, values, errors, etc).
- initiator unique id (`init_uid`): the node uid that initiated this call
- executor unique id (`exec_uid`): the node uid that executes this call
- function id (`fn_id`): the id of the function being called on the node.
    - whether this is an `sync` or `async` function call does NOT need to
      be specified in the message. If it is sync, then `index == cx_id`.
    - Note that `fn_id`'s can mean different things on different nodes.

Byte-by-Byte breakdown:
- u32: `cx_id`: RPC context id
- u8 : message metadata
- u8 : bit-reverse of message metadata (for validation)
- u16: `init_uid`: sender id
- u16: `exec_uid`: receiver id
- u16: `fn_id`: function id

Dependent Next Bytes (in this order)
- If `validation=true`: u16 data length
- If `stream=true`: u16 `count` of stream
    - `count && xEFFF`: the u16 value of count.
    - `count && x8000`: true if this message is the last of the stream
- If `ACK`, u8 ack type
- If `ERR`: u16 err type
- If `ERR`, `VALUE`, `CALL_FN`: the payload
- If `validation=true`: 5 byte CRC of WHOLE message

## Message Metadata
- bit 0: `validation` boolean
- bit 1: `dropable` boolean
- bit 2: `stream` boolean
- bit 3: `--- reserved ---`
- bit 4: `--- reserved ---`
- bit 5-7: type of message

### Message Types
Response Types:
- `0` `ACK`: acknowledge call `fn_id` of `cx_id` (+type)
- `1` `DONE`: return that the function is done
- `2` `KILLED`: return `kill` completed on `fn_id` of `cx_id`
- `3` `VALUE`: return value from call `fn_id` of `cx_id` (+payload)
- `4` `ERR`: return error from a call `fn_id` of `cx_id` (+type&payload)
- `5` `STATUS`: return status from a call of `GET_STATUS` on `fn_id` of `cx_id`

Reserved:
- `6`: `--- reserved ---`
- `7`: `--- reserved ---`
- `8`: `--- reserved ---`
- `9`: `--- reserved ---`
- `A`: `--- reserved ---`

Request Types:
- `B` `CALL_FN`: call function `fn_id` using `cx_id` (+payload)
- `C` `GET_VALUE`: get value/stream of already called function `fn_id` of `cx_id`
- `D` `GET_STATUS`: return `status` object of the `fn_id` of `cx_id`.

Finish Types:
- `E` `KILL`: kill running function or stop stream `fn_id` of `cx_id`
- `F` `CLEAR`: clear cache of `fn_id` using `cx_id`

## Status Type
The `STATUS` message type is returned after receiving `GET_STATUS`.

```
{num_cached: u32, init_uid: u16, running: bool, cached: bool, err: bool, fn_err: bool}
```
- `num_cached` is the number of values cached by the `fn_id` at `cx_id`
- `init_uid` is the initiator's uid  who started the function at this `cx_id`
- `cached` is whether the value (at `count` if `stream=true`) is cached
- `running` is whether `fn_id` at `cx_id` is still running
- `err` is whether the value (at `count` if `stream=true`) is an error
- `fn_err` is whether the whole function had an error (regardless of stream)

`GET_STATUS` can also return the following `ERR`:
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_GET_STATUS`
- `ERR_FN_ID_DNE`

## Ack Types
Only requests are acknowledged. Response types can just be re-requested if they
are dropped. Receiving an ACK is *not necessary* (as `FN_GET_INFO` can be
called for dropped `ACK`) , but not receiving the ack within the network
expected period gives a hint to the caller to re-request the data.

Some requests (i.e. `GET_VALUE`) are requesting the return of a value only *if it
already exists*. Therefore these do not return an ACK, they just return the
value.

- `ACK_FN`: acknowledge function call (call in progress)
- `ACK_CLEAR`: acknowledge clear command
- `ACK_KILL`: acknowledge a kill command (kill not yet done)

## Builtin Err Types
### Err Byte Availability Breakdown:
- `x0000` - `x00FF`: reserved for protocol specific errors
- `x0100` - `x04FF`: reserved for builtin function errors
- `x0400` - `x0FFF`: reserved for registered library errors
- `x1000` - `xFFFF`: open for user defined errors

### Protocol Errors:
#### Unexpected Message Errors:
Since messages can be sent twice (by design), it is possible that "unexpected"
messages were actually just an extra one sent that arrived after the `cx_id` was
cleared. These exactly match the bit pattern of their MsgType.

Response:
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_ACK`: unexpected/extra `ACK` received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_DONE`: unexpected/extra `DONE` received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_KILLED`: unexpected/extra `KILLED` received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_VALUE`: unexpected/extra `VALUE` (or `stream_value`) received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_ERR`: unexpected/extra `ERR` received

Request:
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_FN`: unexpected/extra `CALL_FN` received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_KILL`: unexpected/extra `KILL` call received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_GET_VALUE`: unexpected/extra `GET_VALUE` received
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_GET_STATUS`: unexpected/extra `GET_STATUS` received

Finish:
- `ERR_UNEXPECTED_CLEAR`: unexpected/extra `CLEAR` received

#### Validation Errors
- `ERR_METADATA_CORRUPT`: the message-metadata != ~inverse-message-metadata
- `ERR_MESSAGE_CORRUPT`: `validation=1` and the message failed the CRC check

#### Bridge Node Protocol Errors
- `ERR_UNREGISTERED_INIT`: returned if an `init_id` in a message is not
  registered on a bridge. This represents a critical error.
- `ERR_UNREGISTERED_EXEC`: returned if an `exec_id` in a message is not
  registered on a bridge. Can happen if a bridge gets rebooted and
  hasn't gone through discovery yet.

#### Function Errors
- `ERR_INVALID_INDEX`: indexed function called with invalid index
  (data=current index)
- `ERR_FN_RUNNING`: `FN_CALL` was sent with the `cx_id` of a running function.
  (data=`init_uid` of the initiator)
- `ERR_FN_RAN`: `FN_CALL` was sent with the `cx_id` of a function that already
  completed.
- `ERR_FN_MUST_DROP`: `dropable=0` for a function that must drop.
- `ERR_FN_CANT_STREAM`: `stream=1` on a function that does not support streaming.
- `ERR_FN_CANT_UNLIMITED_STREAM`: `stream=1,count=MAX_U32` on a function
  that does not support unlimited streaming.
- `ERR_FN_MUST_STREAM`: `stream=0` on a function that can only stream.
- `ERR_FN_GET_DROPABLE`: `GET_VALUE` was called with `dropable=1`. Drop-able
  functions will never be able to return cached data.
- `ERR_FN_ID_DNE`: returned from functions like `FN_GET_INFO` if the `fn_id`
  doesn't exist.
- `ERR_CX_ID_DNE`: returned from functions like `FN_GET_INFO` if the `cx_id`
  doesn't exist.

#### Kill Errors:
- `ERR_KILL_DONE`: kill failed, `fn_id` at `cx_id` is already done
- `ERR_KILL_BLOCKED`: kill failed, `fn_id` at `cx_id` is currently blocked
- `ERR_UNKILLABLE`: kill failed, `fn_id` at `cx_id` is not killable

#### Invalid Data Errors:
- `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`: invalid return value
- `ERR_INVALID_ERR_CODE`: invalid error code
- `ERR_INVALID_ERR_DATA`: invalid error data
- `ERR_INVALID_INPUT`: invalid fn input data
- `ERR_INVALID_COUNT`: invalid stream count (data=count)

#### Network Errors
These are network errors and signal to receivers that a network
may be down or that that the io workload may need to be
throttled. Bridges *can* return these.
- `ERR_NODE_UNREACHABLE`: cannot reach a node/bridge (data=`(bridge_id,node_uid)`).
- `ERR_NETWORK_FLOODED`: returned if network is up but too flooded for transfer.

#### Memory Errors: `1110 XXXX`
Device memory errors. User programs can return these as well.
- `ERR_STACK_OVERFLOW`: device ran out of stack memory
- `ERR_HEAP_FRAG`: device heap is too fragmented for msg
- `ERR_HEAP_FULL`: device heap is too full for msg

#### Library Errors: `1111 XXXX`
- `ERR_LIB_BUFFER_FULL`: the library buffer is full.
- `ERR_LIB_ERR`: error with this library's implementation

#### Protocol Log Errors
These errors will never actually be returned since they don't get sent
anywhere but a logging handler. However they are defined for the purpose
of logging/monitoring.

- `ERR_LOG_INVALID_VALUE_COUNT`: a value contained an invalid count (critical)

### Builtin Function Errors
These are errors that are returned by builtin functions, but users
can also use them if they make sense for their own functions.

#### Misc
- `ERR_INTERNAL_ERR`: unknown internal error
- `ERR_INVALID_CLEAR`: a `CLEAR` was sent while the function was still running.

#### Bridge Errors
- `ERR_NODE_NOT_BRIDGE`: returned if bridge functions are called on a node
  that is not a bridge.
